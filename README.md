# ViralSeq-QC

**ViralSeq-QC** is a command-line toolkit for the pre-processing of viral consensus sequences. It automates the detection of assembly artifacts (high N-content), analyzes length distributions, and calculates GC-metrics for viral contigs.

## Features
- **Ambiguity Filter:** Flags contigs with excessive ambiguous bases (N).
- **Length Check:** Validates assembly completeness against thresholds.
- **GC Metrics:** rapid calculation of nucleotide composition.
